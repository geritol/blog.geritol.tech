Good management can spare a lot of effort and frustration for a software development team.
I am trying to collect the stuff I think is important to lead a successful project.

- Communication
  - Single place for project related documentation (not random urls in slack channels)
  - Clear project goals and milestones
  - Clear responses to feature requests (eg. we are thinking on solutions, we have a solution and plan to implement it in 2 weeks versus some generic "we are working on it")
- Transparency (be honest as fuck)
- Try to have as many questions a possible early

  - What do we need to do?
  - Why do we need x?
  - How important is z?
  - Can we cut corners? (delay decision/implementation till we have more information)
  - Think/ rearch/ pose questions before jumping into developing
  - Embrace questions

- At the beginning try to develop as less a possible, avoid long living POCs. If you write code that lives longer than a week make it adhere to the standards (clean, tested code). Be really strict with your MVP
- Make priorities crystal clear
  I have worked on peojects where priorities would change daily
