Original idea: [paul knopf](https://pknopf.com/post/2018-10-13-comments-for-static-sites-using-github-issues/)
Why?

- comments add a lot of value to online content
  How?
- some self hosted/coded service
- some third party service
  --> mostly needs some monthly fees, adds to page load, add adds, privacy

Solution:
Github issues
